# node.js--README-generator

## Description

Using Node.js this project asks several questions within the terminal in order to generate the output of a README.md file. This file is provided with the correct formatting of a README file and includes contact information for the project as well as the creator. Formatting this document through multiple preview testing trails was the most challenging task at hand. I created the content within a function so the spacing and temporal literals needed to be exact to the writing of the file. I learned so much about all the possible details that could go into a README file including Licenses and Badges.

## Usage

In order to use this project, Inquirer package is required for install. You will also need to open Integrated Terminal and run "node index.js" as a command to begin.
